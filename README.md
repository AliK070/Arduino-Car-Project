# Arduino-Car-Project
Here is the code for my arduino car project, there are two folders the processed and the raw folders. The raw folders include the circuit diagram file and the .ino file, while the processed folder contains a viewable, sharable, and readable docuemnt of the code and a .png version of the circuit diagram. 

## Preface
I have tried my best to organize the code through comments and regions for better accessbility. I would also like to mention that this specifc project was made on the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi, that is why you'll see the Arduino_LED_Matrix header file and its functions. To make it compatible with the R3, remove that code. This project was made on two TB6612FNG H-bridges, refer to my blog about them at https://alik070.github.io/Alis-Portfolio/pages/blogs/TB6612FNG.html
